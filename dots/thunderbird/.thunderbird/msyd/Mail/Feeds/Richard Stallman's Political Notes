*Biden housing plan seeks to curb rent increases by
<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/jul/16/biden-rent-control-plan">penalizing
[large] landlords</a>.* The penalties would be triggered by a rent increase of more than 5% in
a year.
<p>
This requires approval from Congress.  Republicans will surely call this a monstrous attack on the
<a href="https://stallman.org/archives/2024-may-aug.html#3_July_2024_(Plutocracy's_historical_mechanics,_USA)">"free
market"</a>.  (A free market means one where the same rules apply to everyone who
participates.)
<p>
Please contact your congresscritter's and senators' offices and ask where they stand on Biden's
plan.  Take notes, and publish what they said.  Preferably in places that the public can see
without getting an account.  (Alas,
<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/30/23779764/twitter-blocks-unregistered-users-account-tweets">ex-Twitter
is not such a place</a> any more.)
<p>
Please vote to defeat <a class=glossary href="/glossary.html#corrupter">the corrupter</a> and all Republicans!
<p>
Nowadays, the increase in prices for many kinds of things is boosted by the lack of
competition.  The advent of large corporations that own very large amounts of rental housing
has reduced the effective competition on rents.
<p>
I think we should prohibited any private entity from controlling more than a minuscule fraction
of the rental housing market.  (I would not put this maximum as low as 50 units &mdash; perhaps
either 500 units or one local physically connected development, whichever is larger.)

UK could be</a> "first Islamist country" with nuclear weapons.*
<p>
That is not physically impossible but it disregards reality completely.  It is bullshit.
<p>
It is also a distraction campaign &mdash; as is usual for right-wing reality rejectors, they
accuse opponents baselessly of actions similar to what the reality rejectors are in fact doing.
The US could very likely become, next January, the first theocratic Christian regime with
nuclear weapons.
<p>
To prevent that, we Americans must vote and work to defeat Republicans at all levels.
<p>
That extends to <em>all</em> Republicans.
<p>
It used to be that there were Republicans that were right-wing but not radical extremists, who
had some integrity left and could coexist with other camps.  Not any more: <a class=glossary href="/glossary.html#wrecker">the wrecker</a> has
converted nearly all to be as dishonest and extreme as he is.  Even those who, like Senator
Collins,

their bills in the senate.

<p>
The scenario of using only 100 trucks, over 15 years, is clearly not a real solution to the
problem.  Using 500 trucks, the job could be finished in 3 years.  But where would they put
this rubble?
<p>
After removing the rubble, could people live there?  Is the land of Gaza poisoned by toxic
chemicals?  And the water in it?

Germany will close the railroad from Frankfurt to Mannheim, a major trunk line, to rebuild it after
<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/jul/15/germany-close-key-rail-corridor-overhaul-train-network-deutsche-bahn">years
of lack</a> of investment.
<p>
I observed this problem when I visited Germany in May, and asked my host/friend about it.  He
said that Germans had become less willing (than in the past) to prioritize the long term future.
<p>
I suspect that that manifests itself as a demand to pay lower taxes, and let the rich pay lower taxes too.

The justification given by the minister is not outright nasty, but I think it is the wrong

<p>
In my view, what he deserves is not <em>sympathy</em> for him, but rather our
<em>indignation on his behalf</em> for the crime attempted against him.
However, that indignation must be partly directed <em>at him</em>, for his
stirring up of the spirit of political violence, which surely has some
role in inspiring the attack on him.

Equinor</a> over its sponsor’s environmental record.*
<p>
The oil company used its donations to partly gag the museum as regards
the most important scientific issue of our time: the harm to the whole
world done by fossil fuels, including those extracted by Equinor.
<p>
It may be true that such gag clauses are "reciprocal and standard",
not that does not mean they are harmless.  Perhaps most of them do
little harm, but in this case it can be deadly.
<p>
Even without an explicit contract committing the museum not to cover
this danger, the desire to get future donations from the company in
the future would tend to corrupt.
<p>
The article mentions that other <a class=glossary href="/glossary.html#planet">planet roaster</a> companies, such as
<a class=glossary href="/glossary.html#bp">Billionaire Polluters</a> and Adani, have given the museum donations.

Israel says it made an air strike
<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/jul/13/hamas-mastermind-of-7-october-attack-killed-in-gaza-strike-claims-israel">to
kill a military leader</a> of HAMAS, and another military leader was in the same area.
<p>
That killing a HAMAS military commander, or even several, is not a step towards Israel's goal
of "wiping out HAMAS".
<a href="https://stallman.org/archives/2011-mar-jun.html#08_May_2011_(al_Qa'ida_Organization)">Generally
it is impossible</a> to destroy an underground resistance group by killing its leaders, as long
as it has popular support.  It will simply recruit new leaders.

The Lancet concluded that HAMAS's count of people killed in Gaza is basically accurate, but
<a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(24">probably an
underestimate</a>.

in Palestine</a> and leaders of them, specifically for their attacks on Palestinians.

That is a good step in the right direction, but taking a step every month or two is very slow
progress.  The first one was a warning shot, which was a good step.  But now it is past time
for heavy fire of sanctions.

Photos from al-Jazeera, confirmed by
<a href="https://www.972mag.com/israeli-soldiers-gaza-firing-regulations/">Israeli soldiers'
testimony</a>, show that it is not unusual for them to shoot unarmed Palestinians for no
military reason.
<blockquote>
The article linked to above contains links to YouTube.  For your freedom and privacy, modify
them to point to <strong>invidio.us</strong> to watch them.
</blockquote>
Further, the Israeli army has very lax rules of engagement.  Soldiers are welcome to shoot
&mdash; whether at a tree or at a human being &mdash; whenever they feel like it.
<p>
HAMAS fighters do not wear uniforms.  So it is indeed not possible to be entirely certain that
an adult Palestinian man walking 100 meters away is not a fighter.  But usually it is possible
to be see that that man is not a threat to anyone at present.  The small chance that he is a
HAMAS fighter does not justify killing someone who is probably a civilian.  Let alone someone
who is surely a civilian; but some soldiers kill even in those circumstances.
<p>
The lawful, and moral, thing to do is to fire a warning shot to tell him to go away.  But the
Israeli army does not order soldiers to do that.
<p>
Although I am not expert enough to state this as a certainty, from what I know I think that
these policies of the Israeli army amount to war crimes for which the highest officers and
officials are responsible.
<p>
Soldiers are also sometimes ordered to burn down or destroy any and all Palestinian houses they
have been using temporarily, citing various irrational justifications.  For instance, they must
make sure not to leave any ammunition or food that Palestinians (presumed to be "terrorists")
might use.
<p>
Destroying food so to make sure that starving Palestinians do not eat it???  Denying food to
the civilians to ensure there is none for the fighters???  That is systemic inhumanity.

When Sharon Johnston, permanently paralyzed, decided to travel to Switzerland to end an
unbearable life, an anthropologist and a political activist accompanies her.  The
British <a class=glossary href="/glossary.html#thug">thugs</a>
<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/article/2024/jul/11/woman-who-went-with-briton-to-dignitas-sues-police-over-her-arrest">arrested
them both when they returned</a> to Britain.
<p>
It is noteworthy that Ms Johnston was not terminally ill.  She might have been condemned to
decades of helplessness, if not for the possibility of seeking aid in suicide.  I can imagine
myself in that same position and wishing for it to end.
<p>
Some states of the US threaten to arrest people who

someone expectant to travel</a> to where abortion is legal.  These two laws are very similar,
and the same arguments prove the injustice of both.

The trial of Just Stop Oil activists was meant to keep the jurors in the dark about what was at
stake.  The defendants repeatedly violated the judge's orders to
<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/article/2024/jul/12/contempt-gagging-un-intervention-uk-wildest-climate-trial-just-stop-oil">speak
the forbidden information</a>.  The jurors paid no attention; they voted to convict.
<p>
I am very disappointed with them.  They had the opportunity to help save civilization and chose
instead to facilitate its destruction.
<p>
But the defendants' effort was not wasted.  The UN rapporteur for
environmental defenders was there, and his report on the trial
was quite stern.
<p>
Side point: I agree that people do not deserve to be punished for making a Zoom call.  However,
using <a href="/zoom.html"></a> Zoom implies being under the power of that company, and that is
itself a punishment.  They should have used <strong>Mumble</strong> or <strong>GNU
Jami</strong> instead.

Right-wingers condemn every government policy that
<a href="https://robertreich.substack.com/p/debunking-myth-7-america-is-socialist">helps the
non-rich</a> live better than hand-to-mouth.
<p>
Socialism is essential for <a href="/articles/why-we-need-a-state.html">many of the
government's important missions</a>.  We don't have enough socialism yet in the US, but I would
oppose a complete move to socialism.  We need individualism and private activities too.
<p>
According to Robert Reich, here is how Harry Truman defended Socialism:
<blockquote>
Socialism is the epithet they have hurled at every advance the people have made in the last 20
years.
<p>
Socialism is what they called public power &hellip; Social Security &hellip; bank deposit
insurance &hellip; free and independent labor organizations &hellip; anything that helps all
the people.
<p>
When the Republican candidate inscribes the slogan "Down With Socialism" &hellip; what he
really means is, "Down with Progress."

<p>
In the 1980s, the IMF was widely rebuked for compelling many poor
countries' governments to cut spending on education, medicine, and
help for the poor, to make those governments repay their debts faster.
It looks like the IMF is still doing that.

Biden criticized the "elite" for <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/article/2024/jul/11/biden-step-down-rich-donors">pressuring him to step aside from
candidacy</a>.  These elite are the rich donors who fund the party's
campaign.
<p>
That sort of elite controls both parties.
<p>
The US has resumed <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/jul/10/biden-resumes-sending-israel-bombs">shipping 500lb bombs to Israel</a>.
Only the 2000lb bombs will still be withheld.
<p>
The practical explanation given for this is rational, as far as it
goes.  But it reflects the lack of effort to convince or pressure
Israel to end its train of war crimes in Gaza.
<p>
I have to wonder if this reflects the demands of the same powerful
"elite" donors.

    <p>
Robert Reich says that <a href="https://robertreich.substack.com/p/theres-only-one-relevant-question">Biden answered well in his latest
press conference</a>, except for momentary verbal slips.
Everyone makes momentary slips, and they don't generally alter
real decisions, so they don't constitute real failings.
<p>
I think that if all US voters understood this point, it
would be better if the Democrats stick with Biden.
<p>
But, as we know, they don't all understand that.  Many overestimate
the significance of verbal slips.  Perhaps, as a consequence, someone
else might be more able than Biden to defeat <a class=glossary href="/glossary.html#corrupter">the corrupter</a>.  If so,
maybe the Democratic Party would do well to switch to that other.
<p>
If Democrats want to try to judge carefully whether to switch to some
other candidate, and induce Biden to cooperate, I suggest the
following procedure.
<ol>
<li>
Press Biden to agree that he will step aside <em>if</em> the
procedure below is followed and chooses someone other than him.
<li>
Press all the delegates and superdelegates to agree to formally
implement the choice that would be made as follows.
<li>
The delegates and superdelegates -- those who would vote in the
convention -- join in anonymous virtual votes to choose a candidate.
It might follow the sequence that the convention would follow.
<li>
If the choice is not Biden, he carries out his commitment to step aside,
and they officially select the candidate.

In Manhattan in the 60s, my life wasn't like Norwegian life, but I had
a similar absence of constant control.  When I meet adults who are

can't go anywhere without parental help, it strikes me as horrible.

Constant controlling and monitoring continues past childhood into
adolescence, so that younger teenagers have nowhere to get away to

Privatization of water and sewer systems in the UK <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/article/2024/jul/09/rise-sewage-pollution-thames-water-ageing-treatment-works">was allegedly going to
inspire investment</a>.
What it actually did was to enable the owners to reduce investment
(maintenance and replacement of systems) to pay themselves bigger
dividends.  <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/article/2024/jul/10/cheap-sales-debt-and-foreign-takeovers-how-privatisation-changed-the-water-industry">The story in more detail</a>.
<p>
That's what we must expect when public functions are privatized, which
is why that is generally a terrible "solution" for most problems and
imperfections in public services.
<p>
The only exception is when the privatized service sells directly to
the public in a well-functioning competitive market where there are
many competitors for each purchase -- but only if efforts to pressure
consumers into fealty to a supplier are made to fail.

past asbestos poisoning, then uses legal schemes to avoid ever paying
damages to the victims who were poisoned.

increase in oil extraction</a>, though it does not "trickle down" to the rest of the
population.  Meanwhile this big local increase in oil extraction will increase the world's
<a class=glossary href="/glossary.html#global%20heating">global heating</a>.
<p>
Similar things are happening in other countries of the
<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/article/2024/jul/08/will-you-stop-exploring-yours-latin-america-forges-ahead-on-new-oil-frontier">Caribbean region and South America</a>.
<p>
We have known since 2011 that the known fossil fuel resources were
<a href="https://stallman.org/archives/2011-may-aug.html#19_July_2011_(The_Carbon_Bubble)">too
much to fit in the world's carbon budget</a>.  Extracting all that fossil fuel, without some
surprise development, would doom civilization.  The discovery of additional fossil resources in
Guyana makes that excess even bigger; it stimulates the pressure from short-sighted businesses
and politicians to burn too much.  (We do not know precisely how much is too much, and when we
do fall over the climate cliff, it will take years to ascertain that fact.)
<p>
A big increase in the total extraction rate of fossil fuels pushes the world further into the
rush to disaster, adding to the cuts in extraction rate that the world needs to do elsewhere,
which the world is already failing to do.  Whether that increase happens in Guyana, the US, or
some other country, the effect is the same.
<p>
Arguing that it is OK to extract more in Guyana because
<a href="https://stallman.org/archives/2024-jan-apr.html#9_March_2024_(norway_judges_undersea_oil)">that
country actually consumes little of the extracted oil</a> is hiding the emissions around under
the rug.  The climate defense movement is already campaigning to stop measuring the emissions
of fossil fuel companies by counting only their own consumption.

The company "Finite Carbon" sells "carbon offsets" based on trees that will be spared the As.
Experts using satellite photos say that
<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/article/2024/jul/11/finite-carbon-forest-offsets-analysis">these offsets do little good</a>
for the climate.
<p>
Of course, it is not unusual for businesses to cheat their customers or the public.  Some of
these offsets are fraudulent &mdash; selling a commitment not to cut down trees
<a href="https://stallman.org/archives/2020-sep-dec.html#16_December_2020_(CO2_offsets)">that
won't be cut down anyway</a>.
<p>
Bu what I noticed about these "offsets" is that they can be bogus even by accident.  The trees
in question could be killed, five or ten or twenty years later, by a wildfire, a disease or
parasite, or desertification.

Most of the firm progressives in the US House of Representatives firmly back Biden, while some

<p>
Biden seems around 1/3 progressive to me.  His low mental acuity in the debate was real, but
everything since then confirm for me that <a class=glossary href="/glossary.html#plutocratist">plutocratists</a> want to replace Biden with someone who
is less than 1/3 progressive.
<p>
Is it crucial to replace Biden?  I think it is necessary if he will lose the election and some
other Democrat would win &mdash; but is that so?  I am no expert on that, but progressives
politicians surely know better than I do.

Israel warned Palestinian civilians remaining in Gaza City that

<p>
I am not firmly committed to Biden as candidate.  My principal goal for this election is to defeat the 
<!---->corrupter.
My secondary goal is get the most progressive possible president.
<p>
If it is feasible to change cleanly and fully to some other
candidate and improve the chances of achieving those goals,
then I am in favor.
<p>
I am not confident that Kamala Harris would be as progressive
as Biden.  (I've estimated Biden as <a href="https://www.stallman.org/notes/2024-may-aug.html#3_May_2024_(Biden)">1/3 progressive</a>.)
<p>
As for whether Harris would have a better chance of defeating
the would-be fascist leader, I don't know.

British public agency workers were asked to do the same work for the
same pay, in 80% of the hours.  They did that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/article/2024/jul/08/largest-uk-public-sector-trial-four-day-week-sees-huge-benefits-research-finds-">eagerly and were much

I don't think all workers will like this, though.  Some are quite
overworked.

Proposing that the way the internet promotes social conflict is
<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/article/2024/jul/07/naomi-alderman-interview-radio-4-series">through
replacement of reciprocal communication (conversation)</a> with one-to-many communication.
<p>
In the age of the printing press, and of broadcast radio and TV, only a few could communicate
their ideas through those; for everyone else, conversation was their only opportunity.
<p>
I am skeptical of her claim that printing, which was a change in a similar direction, brought
about the religious wars in Europe, because such wars had gone on since centuries before.  I
recall two previous series of religious wars, that against the Bogomils (Gnostics) starting
around 1200 and against the Hussites starting around 1400.  In all three cases, it was the
official church against another kind of Christianity.
<p>
The Bogomils used hand-copied books to spread their ideas, and I suppose the Hussites did too.
(This information comes from Wikipedia.)
<p>
I think that the blame for those wars falls on the idea that one doctrine is official, and any
other variant is to be stamped out "by any means necessary."  It was the Roman Empire, in the
4th century, which imposed this.
<p>
That doesn't imply her idea is valueless as regards the internet.

Rebecca Solnit says that some <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/article/2024/jul/06/biden-trump-race-rebecca-solnit">US mainstream media are heavily pushing
the idea that Biden is a bad president, building up pressure for him
to resign</a>.
<p>
They are the point that <a href="https://www.stallman.org/archives/2024-may-aug.html#1_July_2024_(Biden's_supporters_turning_on_him)">he has done a good job compared with the other

that he was held back by the lack of effective Democratic support in
Congress.

    <p>
The first thing Starmer Labour will do is <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/article/2024/jul/06/labour-nick-boles-planning-tsar">appoint a former Tory
minister to weaken the planning system requirements</a> for local approval
of construction projects.
<p>
The change might be good or bad -- the article gives few details.
Tories changed these rules to make it particularly easy to block
approval of wind power generators, and reversing that would surely
be a good thing.
<p>
Under the Tory government, <a href="https://stallman.org/archives/2022-nov-feb.html#19_January_2023_(Right-wing_deregulation)">regulations for construction were
circumvented and disobeyed</a>, resulting in building many buildings with
flammable materials.  One of them had a <a href="https://stallman.org/archives/2022-jan-apr.html#14_April_2022_(London_apartment_fire_and_recommendations_for_building_codes)">big fire in which many
residents died</a>.
<p>
Enforcement of safety regulations is not precisely the same issue as
getting approval for a project, but they are related and they are part
of the same system.  A government that is gung ho for "easing
regulations" is likely be insufficiently careful about which ones.

Information about opposition to slavery
<a href="https://www.gregpalast.com/jefferson-the-abolitionist/">in the pre-revolutionary
colonies</a> that later formed the United States.
<p>
Some comments from me about this.
 <ul><li>
Condemnation of slavery by workers afraid of competition from slaves
is not the same thing as moral condemnation of slavery as an injustice.
 <li>
Free workers concerned about unfair competition from unpaid slaves can make a difference in
the decision about whether to allow slavery.  We can hope that it will do so.  that includes
the case of convicts who are compelled nowadays to work in prison for wages so low that that
undercut and reduce the wages of free workers.
 <li>
The existence in the British colonies of a minority who opposed slavery on moral grounds
is interesting, but they may have been too few to be seen as anything but a fringe group.  It
is not impossible to end an injustice that is deeply embedded in society, but it may take a
struggle.
 </ul>

Meanwhile, I should point out that the Extreme Court's decision applies to accusations against
an ex-president.  I've read that no criminal charges can be made against someone who is
currently president.

A surprisingly powerful hurricane caused near total devastation in
<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/article/2024/jul/04/the-guardian-view-on-hurricane-beryl-the-west-cant-sit-this-out">two
Caribbean islands</a>; nearly all buildings there were destroyed.
<p>
Each hurricane's devastation centers on a few places, but which places
are hit each time is random.  Any place in the hurricane zone could be
devastated by the next hurricane.  As <a class=glossary href="/glossary.html#global%20heating">global heating</a> makes for more
powerful hurricanes, buildings that formerly were probably safe become
vulnerable.
<p>
(Different terms are officially used, rather than "hurricane", for
similar storms in other parts of the world.  For simplicity I write
"hurricane" to refer to all of them.)
<p>
But hurricanes are just one of the dangers we are increasing.  There
are also

<a href="https://stallman.org/archives/2023-sep-dec.html#3_September_2023_(Global_heating_enabling_spread_of_tropical_tiger_mosquitoes)">tropical
diseases</a> and parasites.  Many of these disrupt food production, and that is likely to cause
mass starvation later this century.
<p>
To argue about how much some countries owe other countries because of 
<!---->global heating is
divisive and shortsighted.  All of humanity (and a lot of nature) is in danger from global
heating.  Instead of divisiveness, civilization must unite to curb 
<!----> global heating and decrease
the future danger we are creating.

Many former Labour supporters voted for Labour reluctantly, solely to eliminate Tory rule.
Many others voted Green.  Next time, with less threat from Tories, the

<p>
Competing with the Greens could pressure Labour to stand for what, before Starmer, it used to
stand for.  But if it does not do that, many former Labour voters will become Green voters, and
Starmer will continue making Labour into the image of the former competent but cruel already
cruel Tory Party.

(satire?) If Republicans take power, they will give their followers "herd immunity", meaning
immunity for any crimes they commit in the course of following those leaders.

An Afghan human rights activist who is a woman was arrested by the Taliban, who gang-raped her
in jail.  The rapists made a video to silence her with.  When released, she fled the country,
and they sent her a copy, threatening to publish it if she continued to criticize them.
<p>
Far from being intimidated, she
<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/article/2024/jul/03/video-appears-to-shows-gang-rape-of-woman-in-a-taliban-jail">sent
it to news organizations</a>.
<p>
That is courage.  She does not have anything to be ashamed of -- the
rapists do.
<p>
The article reports on other cases of Taliban's raping, even killing,
women they arrested.
<p>
I suppose they brutalize men also who criticize them, perhaps
in different ways.

The UK and the US both have many crucial national needs that call for
spending money.  If a party tries to woo wealthy voters whose priority
is
<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/article/2024/jun/13/keir-starmer-uk-election-labour-manifesto">not
to pay</a> more tax, by promising not to raise taxes, it has made a choice not to address the
long list of pressing national needs that require spending more money.  By making this choice
for Labour, Starmer has limited it to small change.
<p>
Many Britons supported the Labour Party precisely because its goal was to do something about
that.  It rejected Communism, but advocated an increased level of Socialism.  Now Starmer
thinks to drag them along for lack of a better alternative.
<p>
However, the Liberal Democrats have now pledged to raise taxes on the wealthy to fix the NHS.

Maduro in Venezuela is a bully and does not respect democracy.  Now he
<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/jul/04/venezuela-election-polls-maduro">may
be ousted</a>, but what would come next?
<p>
The article tries to spread Maduro's deserved condemnation on his predecessor, the late
President Chávez.  That is unjust: Chávez was popular.  He was reelected honestly, after the
people had defeated a coup attempt arranged by the US.  He gave Venezuela more socialism but
did not eliminate capitalist business or democracy.
<p>
Maduro, by contrast, is not honest and has not done good for the people.  He inspired strong
opposition, which he overcame by undermining democracy.  But his opposition (including coup
leader Guaido, backed by the US) has not deserved support either.  It showed signs of working
to restore the pre-Chávez <a class=glossary href="/glossary.html#plutocratist">plutocratist</a> authoritarianism.
<p>
Opposition candidate González is described as a stand-in.  For whom, I have to wonder.  Will he
be an improvement over Maduro, or another authoritarian plutocratist?<!---->

Australia plans to require porn sites and antisocial media sites to
<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/article/2024/jul/02/social-media-porn-site-ban-australia-trial-age-assurance">check
users' ages</a>.
<p>
If the system truly did nothing other than determine whether the user's age is above or below N
years, I would not object to it.  However, such systems are likely to demand to see official ID
records, which would identify the user as well as check per age, or take photos, which could be
saved and used to identify the user.

There are plans to implement
<a href="https://taler.net">a way to use GNU Taler</a> to check ages.  Just as Taker payments
allow users to send a store payments that it can validate but cannot use to identify them, the
same technique makes it possible for users to send a site a proof of age that it can validate
but cannot use to identify them.

The Supreme Court ruled that the president has absolute immunity from criminal prosecution over
<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/jul/01/trump-immunity-ruling-affect-criminal-cases">official
acts</a>.  This covers some of the things he is accused of doing to steal the 2020 election.
<p>
I am puzzled by this statement:
<blockquote>
his prosecutors will not be able to introduce as evidence any acts deemed to be official and
struck from the case, even as contextual information for jurors to show Trump’s intent.
</blockquote>
Why should facts be prohibited from use as evidence to prove a crime not covered by immunity,
merely because they are not in themselves criminal?
<p>
The attempted explanation at the end of the article did not make sense to me.

People exposed to explosions tend to show certain kinds of brain damage which often result in
<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/jul/01/blast-exposure-brain-damage-us-navy-suicides">problems
in thinking</a>.
<p>
One case was an instructor who taught soldiers to use hand grenades.  He surely did not explode
them close enough to wound him externally, but he was wounded internally nonetheless.  I wonder
how close to him they were when they exploded.

Boeing has been pressured by the US government to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/article/2024/jul/01/boeing-to-buy-supplier-spirit-aerosystems-deal">buy the part of
Spirit AeroSystems</a> that makes parts for Boeing planes -- a part that
it spun off a few decades ago.
<p>
Spinning off parts or aspects of production is effective for
increasing profits -- by paying some workers less, and by shirking
accountability for whatever goes wrong.  Except that when what goes
wrong is that a plane crashes, the responsibility bounces back.
<p>
I would expect the previous management of Boeing viewed making their
parts in-house as a way to make their planes safer.  So it always
comes back to one's values.

Israeli right-wing politician Moshe Feiglin 
<a href="https://www.commondreams.org/news/moshe-feiglin-hitler">cited Hitler's attitude
towards Jews</a> to explain his own attitude towards Palestinians.
<p>
His version of the Golden Rule must be, "Do one to others before they
do one to you."  Not as a joke, but seriously.
<p>
However, that is the extreme right-wing creed, found in many
countries, and Israelis are not immune to it.  It is shocking, though,
that a Jew would unhesitatingly cite Hitler as a model.

    <p>
The Democratic Party set its convention for August 19-22, but Ohio's
deadline for parties to choose a presidential candidate is Aug 7.  So
the Democratic Party made a plan to have <a href="https://apnews.com/article/ohio-ballot-biden-access-3bf359cce8e73714be45cb99a6e31546">a virtual meeting to formally
vote on the candidate</a>, who had already been chosen by primaries.
<p>
A week ago, that seemed to be a painless plan.  But now that some
consider replacing Biden (if he steps aside) with some other
candidate, it poses a problem: they can't afford to wait for the
convention to make that decision.  They have to arrange a way to
decide in July.

Proposing better ways of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/article/2024/jul/03/labour-housing-policies-tried-failed-radical-solution">addressing the housing shortage</a> instead of the
mostly capitalist ways usually proposed today.
<p>
As a side point, I think the author is mistaken about Labour's
attitude today.  Starmer has publicly rejected the idea of heroic
achievements such as Labour did before.

The UK's "living accommodation" for asylum seekers on former
Wethersfield air base <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/article/2024/jun/30/hunger-strikes-and-suicide-attempts-as-asylum-seekers-claim-essex-site-is-like-prison">feels like a prison</a>.
They are permitted to leave, but it is so isolated that in practice
it is not feasible for them to go anywhere useful to go or where
people they know live.
<p>
This unprison was approved, despite its evident drawbacks, risks and
dangers, because supposedly it would be cheaper, but it ultimately
cost far more than the estimates.  Much like <a href="https://stallman.org/archives/2022-jul-oct.html#12_September_2022_(High_costs_of_operating_nuclear_power_plants)">a nuclear power plant</a>.
<p>
Ultimately, how did the cost of housing asylum seekers there compare
with the usual cost?  What is the usual cost?

The US is prosecuting Boeing for fraud, but reportedly <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/article/2024/jun/30/boeing-justice-department-sweetheart-deal-ethiopian-lion-air">is offering a
plea bargain that will let it off the hook</a> with little punishment.
<p>
Biden is encouraging somewhat more prosecution of lawbreaking
corporations, but that does not go far enough.  To restrain
corporations effectively from dangerous crimes, we should prosecute
the individual executives who decided to break them.

A more precise description of the new presidential immunity from
prosecution: *core executive functions of the presidency have absolute
immunity from prosecution, official acts of the presidency are
presumptively immune, and unofficial acts carry no immunity.* However,
in addition, *official acts cannot be used as evidence at all to
bolster a criminal case.*
<p>
Each part can help a corrupt president to engage in conspiracies
against laws and the Constitution, including those that <a class=glossary href="/glossary.html#corrupter">the corrupter</a>
tried in 2020 and those he threatens to carry out if he wins or steals
the presidency again.
<p>
The judge in <a class=glossary href="/glossary.html#corrupter">the corrupter's</a> trial for violating campaign finance laws
(crimes he committed before he was president) <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/jul/02/trump-hush-money-trial-sentencing-delayed">has delayed the
sentencing, to consider whether any of the evidence in the trial
mentioned subsequent "official" acts</a>.
<p>
*Sotomayor says, in stark dissent, ruling makes president <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/jul/01/sonia-sotomayor-dissent-trump-immunity-case">"king above the law"</a>.*

The rules we have now were decided by the power of plutocrats that bought politicians.  Those
rules are bad for most of us.  Biden has made improvements in some, but big improvements would

Britons who used to look to the Labour Party for something more than small change cling to the
hope it will try to But it can't be soon &mdash; Starmer has promised so clearly and firmly to
reject all that the Labour Party used to stand for that if he did much of that he would be
accused of lying.

Wikileaks changed the nature of journalism, but with many organizations now set up to publish
leaks, there may not be
<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/article/2024/jun/28/you-can-expect-everything-what-next-for-julian-assange-and-wikileaks">a
need for Wikileaks itself</a> to resume doing so.  However, Wikileaks has a reputation for
separating the truth from the disinformation, and that could help the public distinguish the two.

Turkey's urban street dogs befriend the people who live nearby
and are taken care of by them.  Now
<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/article/2024/jun/30/erdogan-cull-turkey-street-dogs">Erdoğan
wants to eliminate them</a>.
<p>
This article suggests some questions to me:
<ol>
 <li>
The street dogs must recognize the people who live in the neighborhood.  How do they treat
strangers?  Do they (or did they) serve to warn the local people about incursions?
 <li>
How were street dogs treated in Anatolia before the Turkish conquest, when it was part of the
Byzantine Empire?  In other words, was this specifically a Turkish custom or was it an older
Anatolian custom?
 <li>
How did the many non-Turks in Anatolia in the 19th century, living under Turkish rule, treat
street dogs?
</ol>

<p>
I dislike the disruption caused by protests, just as many people do.  But climate disaster will
be fatal, perhaps for most of humanity, and will cause massive injustice and suffering along
the way.  The strategies of Just Obey Orders, Just Complain and Just Give Up have failed, so
what should humanity do to protect itself if not this?

Several US states

Uber and Lyft to pay drivers</a> a determined minimum wage, and to provide benefits including

This step forward is a step forward, in those states; it eliminates, there, one of the

However, the injustices to customers &mdash; making users identify themselves to book a ride and
to pay, making them run nonfree software, add tracking their movements &mdash; are unchanged.  As

Supreme Court ruled</a> that cities can imprison people for being homeless.

This is likely to put tens of thousands of Americans in faraway camps that are essentially
prisons and faraway dumping grounds.  Once there, they are likely to die from all sorts of
diseases.

For me, it is clear that punishing people for being poor is inexcusably poor.  Forcing poor
people to live in a place from which they can't get to work is cruel and self-defeating.

Some of Biden's important supporters are <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/jun/29/new-york-times-turns-against-joe-biden-in-walter-cronkite-moment">pressing him to step aside</a>

<p>
Biden is around 30% progressive.  That means (1) a real progressive
would be much better, but (2) he is the most progressive president the
US has had since the 1970s, and it is causing improvements already,
despite opposition from Congress and the Supreme Court.
<p>
Choosing a stronger Democratic candidate would help prevent <a class=glossary href="/glossary.html#wrecker">the wrecker</a>
from winning or stealing the presidency.  But <a class=glossary href="/glossary.html#perse">perse</a> would be chosen
entirely by the smoke-filled rooms of political insiders, with no
primaries for the public to influence the choice.  I am afraid that

Microplastics (which includes pieces as big as 5mm, which I would call
milliplastics) have <a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/microplastic-found-in-penis-infertility-sperm-count-erectile-dysfunction">been found in human penises and testes</a>.
It is possible that they are responsible for the world-wide decrease
in human fertility over the past few decades.
<p>
But that is not proved.  The cause could be PFAS.  Or something else.

Israel and the US jointly affirmed that <a href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/agreeing-with-gallant-us-says-progress-made-in-smoothing-arms-transfer-process/">the US is not withholding any
weapons deliveries except for one shipment of large bombs</a>.
Any other delays were due to bureaucratic complexity.
<p>
Of course, I find this news very discouraging.  Biden showed he had
some leverage, Netanyahu dared him to use it some more, and Biden has
not tried.

I hate it when a "true story" has in fact <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/article/2024/jun/23/the-lost-king-and-baby-reindeer-turning-fact-into-film-fiction-is-a-tricky-business">been altered to make it

enough to sue.
<p>
People writing works of non-fiction should try to be honest to the facts.

*China-owned British Steel said to have <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/article/2024/jun/23/china-owned-british-steel-requested-600m-taxpayer-support">requested &pound;600m of taxpayer
support</a>.*
<p>
Whether the owners are Chinese is a question that there is no need to
ask, because the state should <em>never</em> give money to a business "to
support it."
Instead it should offer to lend money to the company for suitable
repayment, or else buy equity at a fair price.
<p>
These two ways of supporting a company avoid giving the owners an
opportunity to rip off the state -- which the company's owners are likely
to try to do, if they can, regardless of which country they are from.
<p>
With a policy like this, it wouldn't matter which country the
company's owners are from.

Ten years ago we could have confidently counted on the Supreme Court

have tried it.

Those risks would be just a part of the colossal damage that climate disaster causes to
everyone.  But it is useful as a basis to raise the issue here.  An investment company can
easily shrug off damage it will do to the whole world, but damage specifically to its clients
is hard to disregard.

Fedja Stukan, a Bosnian, recently wrote a book about his experiences in the civil war in the
90s.  It criticized Serbia for that; he has also accused Serbia's current government of running
nonfree elections.

The same is true in various other countries.  I've seen places in France, Italy and Turkey that

The UK's right-wing extremist leader, Farage, said that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/article/2024/jun/26/farage-urges-zelenskiy-to-seek-ukraine-peace-deal-with-russia">Ukraine should
give Putin some of its territory</a>.
<p>
Many right-wing leaders seem to be allied with Putin -- starting with
<a class=glossary href="/glossary.html#wrecker">the wrecker</a>. The ones in the US blocked arms for Ukraine to help Putin
conquer some more territory, while Farage cites that as a reason to
accept defeat.
<p>
It may prove impossible to defeat the <a class=glossary href="/glossary.html#putinforces">Putin forces</a> completely, It may
be unavoidable for Ukraine to cede some territory to him, but that
would be a very sad victory for tyrannical conquest.  We should not
let a tyrant conquer without a hard fight.

<p>
A coral reef typically has many species of coral.
I have a suspicion that different species have different rates
of survival.  If the overall rate of survival is 10%, some species
may have 20% survival and some 5% survival, and some 0% survival.
If some species have become locally extinct, that region's coral
reef may be changed permanently.

A substantial fraction Israelis are recognizing that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/article/2024/jun/25/israel-anti-war-movement-impossible">letting the
extreme right wing and the fanatical colonists lead Israel is harmful
to Israel</a>.  Now Israelis are recognizing that they act like tyrants and lead
the state into repression.
<p>
For decades there have always been Israelis who wanted to make peace
with Palestinians, but their numbers have dwindled since the 90s.
Maybe now they will increase.

The expensive US pier, meant to provide a way to land aid from ships,
<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/jun/23/they-miscalculated-gazas-floating-aid-pier-failing-to-deliver-in-rough-seas">has been mostly a failure</a>.  As of June 23, it had been physically
functional for 12 days out of the 37 days it had been in place.
  This is because the waves on the Gaza coast have been higher than
normal, and the designers did not allow enough safety margin for it.
<p>
On most of those 12 days when the pier itself was usable, there was no
transport to take the aid to the starving civilians.
<p>
The rules of war say that attacking a military target with some
civilians nearby must satisfy the criterion of "proportionality".  If
there are a few HAMAS cops near an aid convoy, who are there to keep
security for the convoy, attacking them and endangering the more
numerous] civilians handling the aid (and this ought to count those
whose lives depend on its arrival) cannot satisfy that criterion.
To attack the convoy would be a war crime.
<p>
If Israel did attack the convoy, that would be interference with
delivery of US humanitarian aid.  Under US law the US would have to
suspend weapons deliveries to Israel.
<p>
The US thus has plenty of leverage to make Israel stop blocking this
aid, but does not use it.

he has already spent in Belmarch prison.  (One charge has been filed already by the US for him
to plead guilty to.)  He is now supposed to go to the Mariana Islands (near Guam) to plead
guilty and be
<a href="https://apnews.com/article/assange-plea-deal-wikileaks-justice-department-d329ba4614dbfa77b5eb968d07fd9bd0">sentenced
to "time served"</a>, and then leave for Australia.
<p>
Reportedly
<a href="https://theintercept.com/2024/06/24/julian-assange-plea-deal-biden/">Australia's
support for Assange</a> played a major part in convincing the US to agree to this deal.
<p>
I am very glad for Assange for being out of prison, but I am alarmed that the danger of being
treated similarly will face other journalists and publishers in the future.  If the US had
prosecuted the perpetrators of the actions in the "collateral murder" video, none of this would
have been necessary.
<p>
The plea deal requires approval from the judge.  I wonder what will happen to Assange if the
judge declines to accept the deal.  Could he be sent to a US prison to await trial?
