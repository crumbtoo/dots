<p>The North American TF2 Competitive offseason is kicking off with a bang! Fireside is hosting the Fireside Cup, a $600 (with potential to increase via fundraising), two week cup featuring the best North American sixes players in the region. Not to mention, some of the best teams like <i>Like A G6</i> will be participating! There is one kicker to this cup though: apart from the traditional sixes composition of two scouts, two soldiers, one demoman, and one medic, only one off-class can be on the field at any time.</p><br>

<p>This will force teams to put a little more creativity into how they approach any given scenario throughout the game. Gone are the days of the Engineer reinforced Heavy / Pyro / Sniper last hold! The first week will be a best of two group stage, and the next week will follow with a best of 3 playoffs to decide the winner of the cup.</p><br>

<p>The cup will take place on the weekdays between May 13 - May 23 and will be broadcasted by <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/firesidecasts" target="_blank">Fireside</a> and <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/EssentialsTF" target="_blank">EssentialsTF</a>. Come tune in and watch the best of North America duke it out.</p><br>

<p><a href="https://discord.gg/ybSYAd9" target="_blank">TF2 Coaching Central</a> is back with their seventh North American Newbie 6s Cup, a learning experience and friendly competition for people who are new to competitive 6v6.</p><br>

<p>Players with no to minimal competitive experience will sign up to be placed on a team of six, led by a coach who will teach the basics of how to play the 6v6 format and help you learn the maps. Teams have three weeks to learn and train together before facing off in a tournament with a prize pool of 18 keys for the winners and runners up. Our previous Newbie Cup events have successfully prepared many players and teams to continue competitive play in RGL, the biggest North American TF2 league.</p><br>

<p>Sign-ups are open now, and the deadline to apply to be placed on a team is April 15. Team and coach assignments will be made by April 18 and tournament matches will take place May 11, with the top ranked teams going on to playoffs on May 19.</p><br>

<p>Check out the <a href="https://discord.gg/ybSYAd9" target="_blank">Discord</a> for more info. Whether you're looking to dip your toes in competitive TF2, a more experienced player looking to mentor newbies, or even a fresh install, feel free to join the community - all skill levels are welcome!</p><br>

<p>Dzień dobry from Poland!</p><br>

<p>With temperatures close to freezing, the temptation is high to stay inside and enjoy a hot cup of tea while wrapped in a cosy blanket – but low temperatures will not discourage Europe’s top Team Fortress 2 teams from competing at <a href="https://poland.tf/" target="_blank">poLANd.tf 2024</a> in Łódź, Poland!</p><br>

<p>The 6v6 tournament will feature 16 teams playing at <a href="https://basestack.gg/" target="_blank">BaseStack</a>, bringing the European TF2 community together and warming players’ and spectators’ hearts everywhere when they clash in the server. It’s time to find out which team will rise to the top and claim both the coveted medals and the right to call themselves the best in Europe.</p><br>

<p>The LAN will take place from Friday, February 23rd to Sunday, February 25th starting at 3 pm CET (9 am EST | 6 am PST) on each day. You can follow the action by tuning into <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/essentialstf" target="_blank">EssentialsTF’s live coverage on Twitch</a>.</p><br>

<p>In a winter wonderland, there's no better way to stay warm than a comfy seat by the fire and a mug of cocoa at your side. At Mann Co., the fire in question just so happens to be the entire lobby of HQ.</p><br> 

<p>Certainly not months overdue, it's the newest Fortress Faceoffs event featuring a particularly mischievous mercenary, the Pyro! After the parking lot incident, Pyro has been sent away on a "holiday vacation" of sorts after being sent to clear out the company parking lot and getting a little too carried away. As a result, Fortress Faceoffs has taken it upon themselves to sort out a new mission for the little trailblazing traveler!</p><br> 

<p>Teams of five will be tasked with putting an end to the dreadful desolation of winter. With some of the newest equipment in the arsonist's arsenal, including a <b>custom-made pair of running shoes</b>, you must make yourself known as King of the Hill and Hater of All That Is Snow in the most heated happening since the Phlogistinator! Explore scenic resorts and beachsides as you ponder life's deepest questions, such as "Is the life of a mercenary really for me?" or "Hang on, when did I turn into a pile of ash?"</p><br> 

<p>Sign up today to get your first-class seats on the only vacation you might ever get! The games begin on <b>February 23rd @ 11:59 PM / 23:59 BST</b> for all regions and will continue for roughly 2 weeks, though you do NOT have to actively participate this long! The top 8 teams will have their talent shown off <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/fortressfaceoffs" target="_blank">live</a>, showing that grubby groundhog who really decides when winter ends!</p><br>

<p>For more information about event rules, prizes, and more, join the <a href="https://fortressfaceoffs.tf/discord-server" target="_blank">Fortress Faceoffs Discord</a> and remember to wipe your shoes off at the doormat!</p><br>

<p>The best party is the one that happens after the normal people have gone home; before school or work has woken and you’re just hanging out with some chums, having fun.</p><br>

<p>Saturday 6th Jan @ 2:00 PM EST / 20:00 CET sees the <b>TFConnect Afterparty</b> or “KritzKast Creator Showdown”, for short. They’re doing some unrestricted 6s with the likes of <i>FUNKe, berd, LazyPurple, Solid JJ, Solarlight</i> and many more. First pitting two EU teams against each other. Then two North American teams fight to decide who plays with whom in the ultimate form of mad combat: 12v12* ChaosMOD, casted by KritzKast, <i>HamajiNeo</i> and other friends.</p><br>

<p>Here your donations to the charity <a href="https://www.specialeffect.org.uk/" target="_blank">SpecialEffect</a> via TFConnect decide both where the match happens and how tough a time these teams have. Donate LIVE to enable temporary effects; see how well <i>Skymin</i> flies in low grav, how long <i>Dollie</i> lives with one hit point, how dangerous <i>Uncle Dane</i> is with critz enabled, as well as more, far worse ideas. There’s nothing this mod can’t do!**</p><br>
